# CS5284_Graph_ML

This project seeks to improve movie recommendations by using the MovieLens dataset and movie plot summaries scraped from the web. By incorporating both user preferences and the content of movie plots into a Graph Neural Network (GNN), the system will capture not only what users enjoy but also patterns in storytelling and archetypes that resonate with human preferences. The motivation is to build a system that understands both user behavior and the deeper narrative structures that attract audiences to specific films.
