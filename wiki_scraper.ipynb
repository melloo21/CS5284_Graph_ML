It is a [[coming of age]] film in which a group of high school and college-aged teenagers sign up for several months of training aboard a sailing ship, a [[brigantine]], and travel around half the globe when suddenly they are challenged by a severe storm. The film stars [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Caroline Goodall]], [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]], [[Scott Wolf]], [[Jeremy Sisto]] and [[Balthazar Getty]].\\n\\nThe film was based on the 1962 book \\'\\'The Last Voyage of the Albatross\\'\\' by Charles Gieg Jr. and Felix Sutton.\\n\\n==Plot==\\n\\nThe film is based on the fate of the [[brigantine]] \\'\\'[[Albatross (1920 schooner)|Albatross]]\\'\\', which sank May 2, 1961, allegedly because of a [[white squall]]. The film relates the ill-fated school sailing trip led by Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), whom the boys call \"Skipper\". He is tough and teaches them discipline. He forms a close connection with well-off Chuck Gieg ([[Scott Wolf]]), troubled rich kid Frank Beaumont ([[Jeremy Sisto]]), shy Gil Martin ([[Ryan Phillippe]]) and bad boy Dean Preston ([[Eric Michael Cole]]). On the first days, it is discovered that Gil suffers from [[acrophobia]] when he fails to aid the choking Chuck who becomes entangled after slipping from a mast. He is instead saved by Skipper Sheldon while Gil is ordered to climb the ropes, something he ultimately cannot do, and is therefore assigned limited duty on board.\\n\\nFrank\\'s snobby attitude causes him to bump heads with most of the boys. Gil opens up to Chuck about his troubled home life one night in their bunks, which Frank listens to and identifies with as well.\\n\\nAfter many misadventures on land and on the boat, the boys begin to take Skipper\\'s teachings seriously and act like real shipmates, forming stronger bonds.\\n\\nEventually, the brigantine goes into shore and the boys take leave on land. Frank\\'s wealthy father and mother give him a surprise visit while the crew is in port. Frank is upset by the poor timing of the visit, as he becomes separated from the boys and their festivities when his overbearing parents require him to go out to a steak dinner with them. The father and son end up in a fist fight and become further estranged. Frank drinks and goes to the party, only to be escorted out by Chuck, Gil and Dean.\\n\\nAfter a night of festivities, the crew set out to sea again on the next day. When the brigantine encounters a school of dolphins, Frank, still angry at his father, vents his fury by shooting one of the dolphins with a harpoon. Skipper demands Frank at least put the animal out of its misery, but he can\\'t bring himself to, so Skipper kills it, then tells Frank he\\'s been expelled from the program and puts him ashore at the next port. The day he leaves, Frank apologizes to Skipper for the incident on the boat and is given a farewell by Gil, who gets the courage to climb up the ropes to ring the bell for Frank, which symbolizes ‘Where we go one, we go all.’\\n\\nSoon after, while at sea, the brigantine encounters a freakish white squall storm. The vessel is battered by the seas, and the boys try to use what the Skipper has taught them in order to survive the horrific ordeal. Most of them succeed in abandoning the vessel, but Gil, Dean, Skipper\\'s wife Alice, and the cook Girard Pascal all drown.\\n\\nWhen the survivors are rescued and reach land, Skipper is put on trial, with Frank\\'s powerful parents leading the call for his license to be revoked. Eventually, Skipper refuses to allow anyone else to be blamed for the disaster, and accepts responsibility, but his former students all stand up for him. Frank turns against his bullying parents to support the Skipper, as all of the boys embrace him. The end credits explain that in reality six people died in total (four students) and dedicates the film to them.\\n\\n==Cast==\\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Captain Christopher \"Skipper\" Sheldon\\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Alice Sheldon\\n* [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] as McCrea\\n* [[Scott Wolf]] as Chuck Gieg\\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as Frank Beaumont\\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Gil Martin\\n* [[Eric Michael Cole]] as Dean Preston\\n* [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]] as Girard Pascal\\n* [[Balthazar Getty]] as Tod Johnstone\\n* [[Jason Marsden]] as Shay Jennings\\n* [[David Lascher]] as Robert March\\n* [[Ethan Embry]] as Tracy Lapchick\\n* [[David Selby]] as Francis Beaumont\\n* [[Jordan Clarke (actor)|Jordan Clarke]] as Charles Gieg, Sr.\\n* [[Željko Ivanek]] as Captain Sanders\\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Captain Tyler\\n* [[Jill Larson]] as Peggy Beaumont\\n* Lizzy Mackay as Middy Gieg\\n* Ray De-Haan as Stunt Performer\\n\\n==Production==\\nPart of the film was shot using a [[horizon tank]] in Malta, with a full-sized mock-up of the ship, the \\'\\'[[Eye of the Wind]]\\'\\', used to depict the \\'\\'Albatross\\'\\' in scenes shot mainly in the Caribbean, on islands such as St. Vincent and the Grenadines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mediterranean Film Studios - Unique Water Tanks|url=http://www.pcpmalta.com/tanks.html|access-date=10 May 2017|archive-date=11 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611165726/http://www.pcpmalta.com/tanks.html|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Maurice Jarre]] was originally scheduled to compose the original score, but was replaced by [[Hans Zimmer]]\\'s protégé [[Jeff Rona]].

The site\\'s consensus states: \"Though it gets occasionally bogged down by touchy-feely sentiment, \\'\\'White Squall\\'\\' benefits greatly from Jeff Bridges\\' assured lead performance and Ridley Scott\\'s visceral, exciting direction\".<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_squall/ \\'\\'White Squall\\'\\'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806163725/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_squall |date=2020-08-06 }} at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]</ref> \\'\\'White Squall\\'\\', like Scott\\'s previous film, \\'\\'[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]\\'\\', was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]].\\n\\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave it three stars.

[[Jack Lemmon]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Burgess Meredith]], [[Daryl Hannah]], [[Kevin Pollak]], and [[Katie Sagona]] reprised their roles. This was Meredith\\'s final film before his death in 1997.\\\\n\\\\n==Plot==\\\\nThe feud between Max and John has cooled and they have become good friends. Their children, Melanie and Jacob, have become engaged. Meanwhile, John is enjoying his marriage to new wife Ariel. John and Max still call each other \\\\\"moron\\\\\" and \\\\\"putz\\\\\" respectively but with friendly intentions.\\\\n\\\\nThe spring and summer fishing season is in full swing with the annual quest to catch \\\\\"Catfish Hunter,\\\\\" an unusually large [[catfish]] that seems to enjoy eluding anyone who tries to catch it. However, the local bait shop closed after Chuck, the previous owner, died in the first movie. Maria Ragetti has purchased the property with the intent of converting it into a fancy Italian restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nIrritated it will no longer be a bait shop, Max and John join forces to sabotage the restaurant. They are successful at first with their [[practical jokes]]. However, when Ariel learns what is going on, she tells John to apologize to Maria at once, and he does after Ariel kicks him out of the house. Max and Maria begin dating after discovering a shared passion for fishing, while her mother Francesca dates John\\'s father, J.W.\\\\n\\\\nTo complicate things further, Jacob and Melanie call off their engagement due to stress from their parents\\' involvement. Upon hearing the news, John and Max reignite their feud and go back to their childish pranks again such as John cutting a hole in Max\\'s fishing net and detaching the anchor to his boat. Max retaliates by disconnecting John\\'s motor from his boat and broadcasting him nude (while Ariel was making a clay statue of him) at a Sears department store. Ariel is stressed out because of it and leaves John until things settle down. At the restaurant, Francesca is worried about all the time Maria spends with Max. She reminds her daughter of her five failed marriages and worries that Max will make it six.\\\\n\\\\nAfter being convinced to take a long look at herself, Maria reluctantly stops seeing Max. Distraught over losing Ariel, John heads to the lake for his father\\'s advice but finds that he has died in his favorite spot with a fishing pole in one hand and a can of beer in the other. Following the funeral and the spreading of J.W.\\'s ashes in the lake, John and Max call off their feud again.\\\\n\\\\nAfter realizing that their inability to properly plan a wedding is what drove their kids to call it off, they decide to set it right. They help Jacob and Melanie reconcile, explaining their drama. John decides to reconcile with Ariel and convinces Max to talk to Maria. He does and convinces her to take a chance on him, while convincing her mother that he\\'s not going to be like her previous sons-in-law. John and Max manage to catch \\\\\"Catfish Hunter\\\\\" but they reluctantly decide to release it so it can be with J.W. in the lake. After they let it go, they realize that they\\'re late for a wedding happening in town and rush to the church as quickly as they can. The wedding is revealed to be for Max and Maria, who have reconciled (Jacob and Melanie have eloped). On the way to their honeymoon, they discover Max\\'s one-eyed bulldog, Lucky, in the car with them, being put there by John earlier as a prank. Ragetti\\'s is also reformed so it will be both a restaurant and a bait shop.\\\\n\\\\n==Cast==\\\\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as John Gustafson Jr., the neighbor of Max\\\\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Max Goldman, the neighbor of John\\\\n* [[Ann-Margret]] as Ariel Truax Gustafson, John\\'s 2nd wife\\\\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti Goldman, Max\\'s 2nd wife\\\\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Melanie Gustafson, John\\'s daughter\\\\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Jacob Goldman, Max\\'s son and Melanie\\'s husband\\\\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as John Gustafson Sr., John\\'s father\\\\n* [[Max Wright]] as County Health Inspector\\\\n* [[Ann Morgan Guilbert]] as Francesca \\\\\"Mama\\\\\" Ragetti, Maria\\'s mother\\\\n* [[Katie Sagona]] as Allie Gustafson, Melanie\\'s daughter\\\\n\\\\n==Production==\\\\nMeredith\\'s [[Alzheimer\\'s disease]] worsened and he had to be coached through his role in the film.\\\\n\\\\n==Reception==\\\\n\\\\n=== Box office ===\\\\n\\'\\'Grumpier Old Men\\'\\' grossed $71 million at the North American box office, against a production budget of $25 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Weekend Box Office: \\'Exhale\\' Blows Down the Competition |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-12-27-ca-18149-story.html |access-date=2012-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Weekend Box Office: Rosy News for Hollywood, \\'Monkeys\\' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-01-09-ca-22520-story.html |access-date=2012-06-01}}</ref> The film was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on March 1, 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=19960301|title=UK Weekend Box Office 1st March 1996 - 3rd March 1996|publisher=www.25thframe.co.uk|access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref>\\\\n\\\\n=== Critical response ===\\\\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 21% based on 19 reviews, with a rating average of 4.2/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grumpier_old_men/|title=Grumpier Old Men (1995)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=January 16, 2023}}</ref> On  [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score of 46 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\\\\"mixed or average reviews\\\\\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Grumpier Old Men reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/grumpier-old-men | publisher=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=July 22, 2017}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \\\\\"A\\\\u2212\\\\\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\\\\\"CinemaScore\\\\\">{{cite web |title=CinemaScore |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |work=cinemascore.com}} (Type \\\\\"Grumpier Old Men\\\\\" in search)</ref>\\\\n\\\\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a score of 2 out of 4 stars.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ebert |first=Roger |date=December 22, 1995 |title=Grumpier Old Men |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/grumpier-old-men-1995 |access-date=2012-06-01}}</ref> Kevin Thomas of the \\'\\'[[Los Angeles Times]]\\'\\' described the film as contrived and getting by on the star power of the cast.<ref>{{cite news |author=Thomas |first=Kevin |date=December 22, 1995 |title=MOVIE REVIEW: Stars Add Luster to \\'Men\\'s\\' Contrived Tale |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-12-22-ca-16733-story.html |access-date=2012-06-01}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] of \\'\\'[[The New York Times]]\\'\\' wrote: \\\\\"\\'\\'Grumpier Old Men\\'\\', which was directed by Howard Deutch from a screenplay by Mark Steven Johnson, who also wrote the first film, doesn\\'t even try to make sense.
